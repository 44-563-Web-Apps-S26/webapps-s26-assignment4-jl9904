    <p class="song sirjoseph">
        When I was a lad I served a term<br>
        As office boy to an Attorney's firm.<br>
        I cleaned the windows and I swept the floor,<br>
        And I polished up the handle of the big front door.<br><br>

        I polished up that handle so carefullee<br>
        That now I am the Ruler of the Queen's Navee!

    <h4 class="name sirjoseph">SIR JOSEPH</h4>
    <p class="song sirjoseph">
        As office boy I made such a mark<br>
        That they gave me the post of a junior clerk.<br>
        I served the writs with a smile so bland,<br>
        And I copied all the letters in a big round hand—<br><br>

        I copied all the letters in a hand so free,<br>
        That now I am the Ruler of the Queen's Navee!

    <h4 class="name sirjoseph">SIR JOSEPH</h4>
    <p class="song sirjoseph">
        In serving writs I made such a name<br>
        That an articled clerk I soon became;<br>
        I wore clean collars and a brand-new suit<br>
        For the pass examination at the Institute,<br><br>

        And that pass examination did so well for me,<br>
        That now I am the Ruler of the Queen's Navee!

    <h4 class="name sirjoseph">SIR JOSEPH</h4>
    <p class="song sirjoseph">
        Of legal knowledge I acquired such a grip<br>
        That they took me into the partnership.<br>
        And that junior partnership, I ween,<br>
        Was the only ship that I ever had seen.<br><br>

        But that kind of ship so suited me,<br>
        That now I am the Ruler of the Queen's Navee!

    <p class="song sirjoseph">
        I grew so rich that I was sent<br>
        By a pocket borough into Parliament.<br>
        I always voted at my party's call,<br>
        And I never thought of thinking for myself at all.<br><br>

        I thought so little, they rewarded me<br>
        By making me the Ruler of the Queen's Navee!

        Now landsmen all, whoever you may be,<br>
        If you want to rise to the top of the tree,<br>
        If your soul isn't fettered to an office stool,<br>
        Be careful to be guided by this golden rule—<br><br>

        Stick close to your desks and never go to sea,<br>
        And you all may be rulers of the Queen's Navee!
