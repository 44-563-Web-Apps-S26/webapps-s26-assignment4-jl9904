    <h3>ACT I</h3>
    <p><em>[Enter SIR JOSEPH with COUSIN HEBE]</em></p>

    <h4>SIR JOSEPH</h4>
    <p><strong>SONG</strong></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">
        I am the monarch of the sea,<br>
        The ruler of the Queen's Navee,<br>
        Whose praise Great Britain loudly chants.
    </p>

    <h4>COUSIN HEBE</h4>
    <p><strong>SONG</strong></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 20px;">
        And we are his sisters, and his cousins and his aunts!
    </p>

    <h4>REL.</h4>
    <p><strong>SONG</strong></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 20px;">
        And we are his sisters, and his cousins, and his aunts!
    </p>

    <h4>SIR JOSEPH</h4>
    <p><strong>SONG</strong></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">
        When at anchor here I ride,<br>
        My bosom swells with pride,<br>
        And I snap my fingers at a foeman's taunts;
    </p>

    <h4>COUSIN HEBE</h4>
    <p><strong>SONG</strong></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 20px;">
        And so do his sisters, and his cousins, and his aunts!
    </p>

    <h4>ALL</h4>
    <p><strong>SONG</strong></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 20px;">
        And so do his sisters, and his cousins, and his aunts!
    </p>

    <h4>SIR JOSEPH</h4>
    <p><strong>SONG</strong></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">
        But when the breezes blow,<br>
        I generally go below,<br>
        And seek the seclusion that a cabin grants;
    </p>

    <h4>COUSIN HEBE</h4>
    <p><strong>SONG</strong></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 20px;">
        And so do his sisters, and his cousins, and his aunts!
    </p>

    <h4>ALL</h4>
    <p><strong>SONG</strong></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 20px;">
        And so do his sisters, and his cousins, and his aunts!<br><br>
        His sisters and his cousins,<br>
        Whom he reckons up by dozens,<br>
        And his aunts!
