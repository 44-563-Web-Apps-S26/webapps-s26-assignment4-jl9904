    <p class="song sirjoseph">
        I am the monarch of the sea,<br>
        The ruler of the Queen's Navee,<br>
        Whose praise Great Britain loudly chants.

    <p class="song sirjoseph">
        When at anchor here I ride,<br>
        My bosom swells with pride,<br>
        And I snap my fingers at a foeman's taunts;

    <h4 class="name cousinhebe">COUSIN HEBE</h4>
    <p class="song cousinhebe">
        And so do his sisters, and his cousins, and his aunts!

    <p class="song sirjoseph">
        But when the breezes blow,<br>
        I generally go below,<br>
        And seek the seclusion that a cabin grants;
    </p>

    <h4 class="name cousinhebe">COUSIN HEBE</h4>
    <p class="song cousinhebe">
        And so do his sisters, and his cousins, and his aunts!

        And so do his sisters, and his cousins, and his aunts!<br><br>
        His sisters and his cousins,<br>
        Whom he reckons up by dozens,<br>
        And his aunts!
